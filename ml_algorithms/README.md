# ðŸ§  Classical Machine Learning Algorithms

This folder explores foundational ML algorithmsâ€”implemented from scratch where possible, and compared with scikit-learn implementations.

## âœ… Focus Areas

- Clear mathematical intuition & assumptions
- From-scratch implementations (in Python)
- Trade-offs, overfitting risks, and performance metrics
- Visualization & practical use-cases

## ðŸ“Œ Topics

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (with kernels)
- Clustering (k-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- PCA (as a bonus for dimensionality reduction)

## ðŸ§ª Goals

- Reproduce toy datasets and visualizations (e.g. UCI, sklearn datasets)
- Measure accuracy, precision/recall, and cross-validation
- Understand when and why these methods fail

## Tracklist:
- 17/18 July 2025: Linear_regression Refresher
