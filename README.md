# 🧠 ml_learning_weekly

This repository documents my **continuous learning journey in Machine Learning**. It serves both as a personal knowledge base and a public demonstration of my growing proficiency in core ML domains.

## 🎯 Goal

To **systematically deepen my understanding** of key Machine Learning concepts through hands-on implementations, code-first experimentation, and weekly documentation.

The focus areas include:

- 📊 **Statistical & Mathematical Theory**  
  Foundations such as linear algebra, calculus, probability, optimization, and information theory.

- 🧠 **Algorithms & Modeling**  
  Core ML topics including regression, classification, clustering, deep learning, ensemble methods, and more.

- ⚙️ **MLOps & Dev Pipelines**  
  Tools and practices for reproducible ML: model tracking, data versioning, deployment, Docker, CI/CD, etc.

- 🧩 **Miscellaneous & Applied Topics**  
  Real-world projects, Kaggle notebooks, research paper reproductions, and exploratory ideas.
