# ðŸ§¬ Deep Learning Fundamentals

This folder revisits the core theory of neural networks, guided by *Goodfellow et al., Deep Learning*, and implements models using PyTorch.

## âœ… Focus Areas

- Forward & backward propagation from scratch
- Intuition behind gradients, activations, and loss functions
- PyTorch: building, training, and evaluating models
- CNNs, MLPs, and optimizers

## ðŸ“˜ Key Chapters (Goodfellow)

- Ch 6â€“7: Optimization for Training Deep Models
- Ch 8â€“9: CNNs & RNNs
- Ch 5: Deep Feedforward Networks

## ðŸ§ª Goals

- Implement 1-layer MLP from scratch (numpy)
- Build a simple digit recognizer using PyTorch
- Visualize training loss, weight updates
- Understand overfitting and regularization
