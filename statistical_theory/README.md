# ðŸ“Š Statistical Theory for Machine Learning

This folder focuses on statistical intuition and how it informs model decisions, especially around classification, error analysis, and uncertainty.

## âœ… Focus Areas

- Likelihood, Bayes Theorem, Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Bias/variance tradeoff
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing
- Distributions used in ML

## ðŸ§ª Goals

- Derive likelihood functions for Bernoulli, Normal models
- Implement basic classifiers (naive Bayes)
- Simulate CLT and hypothesis tests in code
- Visualize error regions and decision boundaries
