# ⚙️ ML Engineering & Pipelines

This folder introduces tools and workflows for building scalable, reproducible ML systems.

## ✅ Focus Areas

- Model versioning (MLflow / DVC)
- Data pipelines with Pandas & PySpark
- Reproducibility: environments, dependencies, containers (Docker)
- Deployment: REST APIs and simple inference pipelines

## 🧪 First Goals

- Rework a toy ML model into a tracked pipeline (e.g., using MLflow)
- Log metrics, save checkpoints
- Create a REST API for inference (FastAPI or Flask)
- Visualize pipeline stages using diagrams

## 🔧 Tools to Learn

- DVC or MLflow
- Docker
- Prefect or Airflow (later)
